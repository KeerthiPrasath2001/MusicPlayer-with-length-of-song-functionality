# MusicPlayer-with-length-of-song-functionality
Nicely working Music player with awesome features of finding total length of music as well as the current playing length .

...............Modules used.........................
1. pygame : pygame is a external library used for making games but i used it's mixer.music class which is  responsible for playing music 
            so before running this script please install pygame in your system.
    
2. mutagen : The logic behind finding the song length and current played song length is done by using mutagen , same like pygame mutagen is 
             also a external library so before running this script please make sure you also installed mutagen in your system .
             and this music player is only works with .MP3 songs , not with other formats .
             
3. tkinter : the only built-in library used in this project is tkinter , i choose tkinter because of its easy synatx and simplicity .
